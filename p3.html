<h3>Artificial  Intelligence  Applications:  Marketing</h3>
<p>Marketing  is  a  way  to  sugar coat  your products  to  attract  more customers. We,  humans,  are  pretty  good  at  sugar  coating,  but  what  if  an  algorithm  or a bot is  built  solely  for the  purpose of marketing  a  brand  or a  company?  It would  do  a pretty  awesome job ! In  the early  2000s, if  we searched  an  online store  to  find  a  product without  knowing  it’s  exact  name,  it  would  become a  nightmare to  find  the product.  But  now  when  we search  for an  item  on  any  e-commerce store, we get  all  possible results  related  to  the item.  It’s  like  these  search engines  read  our minds! In  a  matter of seconds,  we get  a list  of  all relevant  items.  An  example of this  is  finding  the right  movies  on  Netflix.</p>
<h3>Artificial  Intelligence Applications:  Banking</h3>
<p>AI in  banking  is  growing  faster  than  you  thought! A  lot  of banks  have already  adopted AI-based  systems  to  provide customer support,  detect anomalies  and  credit  card  frauds.  An  example  of  this  is  HDFC Bank . HDFC Bank  has  developed  an AI-based  chatbot  called  EVA  (Electronic Virtual  Assistant),  built  by  Bengaluru-based  Senseforth  AI Research Since its  launch,  Eva  has  addressed  over 3  million  customer queries, interacted  with  over half a  million  unique users,  and  held  over a  million conversations.  Eva can  collect  knowledge from  thousands  of sources  and provide simple answers  in  less  than  0.4  seconds</p>

<h3>Artificial  Intelligence  Applications:  Finance</h3><p>Ventures  have  been  relying  on  computers  and  data scientists  to  determine future  patterns  in  the  market.  Trading  mainly  depends  on  the ability  to predict  the future accurately Machines  are great  at  this  because they  can  crunch  a  huge  amount  of data in  a  short  span.  Machines  can  also  learn  to  observe  patterns  in  past  data and  predict  how  these  patterns  might  repeat  in  the future . . In  the age  of ultra-high-frequency  trading,  financial  organizations  are turning  to  AI to  improve their stock  trading  performance and  boost  profit</p><center>

<h3>Artificial  Intelligence  Applications:  Space  Exploration</h3>
<p>Space expeditions  and  discoveries  always  require analyzing  vast  amounts of data.  Artificial  Intelligence and  Machine  learning  is  the best  way  to handle and  process  data  on  this  scale.  After rigorous  research, astronomers  used  Artificial  Intelligence to  sift  through  years  of  data obtained  by  the Kepler telescope  in  order to  identify  a  distant  eight-planet solar  system Artificial  Intelligence  is  also  being  used  for  NASA’s  next rover mission to  Mars,  the Mars  2020  Rover.  The AEGIS,  which  is  an AI-based  Mars rover is  already  on  the red  planet.  The rover is  responsible for autonomous  targeting  of cameras  in  order to  perform  investigations  on Mars</p>
